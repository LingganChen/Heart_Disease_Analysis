## Introduction

Heart disease is a common health condition that can have serious consequences if not diagnosed and treated early. In this analysis, we aim to explore and model heart disease data to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on several medical attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). It contains various features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, and more. The target variable is "presence," which indicates the presence (value 1, 2, 3, or 4) or absence (value 0) of heart disease.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

During the exploratory data analysis phase, we will visualize the data to gain insights into the distribution of features and their relationships with the target variable. We will use various plots such as histograms, bar charts, and correlation matrices to understand the data.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning project. It involves handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. Additionally, we will split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of our models.

## Feature Selection

To improve the model's performance and reduce overfitting, we will perform feature selection. This step involves selecting the most relevant features that contribute the most to predicting the presence of heart disease. Techniques such as SelectKBest and chi-square tests will be used to select the best features.

## Model Building

In this analysis, we will employ several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, random forests, and naive Bayes classifiers. We will train these models on the training dataset and fine-tune their hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.

## Model Evaluation

The trained models will be evaluated on the testing dataset using various performance metrics. Additionally, we will create confusion matrices to visualize the performance of each model in predicting the presence or absence of heart disease.
